# Understanding Support Vector Machine Kernels Through Visualisation

This repository provides an educational and experimental exploration of **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and the effect of different kernel functions on classification performance and decision boundaries. The project combines a **Jupyter Notebook implementation** with an accompanying **academic-style PDF report** to build both practical intuition and theoretical understanding.

## 📌 Project Overview

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning algorithms widely used for classification tasks. A key strength of SVMs lies in their use of **kernel functions**, which allow models to learn non-linear decision boundaries.

This project:
- Demonstrates **Linear**, **Polynomial**, and **Radial Basis Function (RBF)** kernels
- Uses a **non-linearly separable two-moons dataset**
- Visualises decision boundaries for intuitive comparison
- Explores **hyperparameter effects**, including the bias–variance trade-off
- Discusses **ethical and practical considerations** of kernel-based models

## 🧪 Dataset

The project uses a **synthetic two-moons dataset** generated via `scikit-learn`.  
This dataset is intentionally non-linearly separable, making it ideal for demonstrating the limitations of linear classifiers and the strengths of kernel-based SVMs.

## 📊 Key Results

| Kernel Type | Approx. Test Accuracy | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|------|
| Linear     | ~85%                 | Underfits non-linear data |
| Polynomial (degree 3) | ~87% | Improved flexibility |
| RBF        | ~96–97%              | Best performance |
